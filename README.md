# Kick Starter Projects Classification
## GENERAL INTRODUCTION

The dataset was obtained from the website Kaggle which is the subsidiary of Google LLC, where datasets are published and posted for data scientists and machine learning practitioners to explore and analyze to hone their skills. The dataset was gathered and uploaded by Mickaël Mouillé on November 6, 2017 and was last updated as of writing on February 8, 2018. The user is a crowdfunding enthusiast and he has been watching kickstarter since its early days. He has been collecting data and the only app he has made is this twitter bot which tweet any project reaching some milestone: @bloomwatcher and this dataset is collected from Kickstarter Platform. 


This project I will use his useful data to build models in order to anticipate the state of a kickstarter project.

***I) DATA INSPECTION:***

1) IMPORT LIBRARIES AND DATASET

2) GENERAL DESCRIPTION

3) VISUALIZATION OF DATASET

***II) DATA CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION***

1) DEALING WITH NULL VALUE

2) DEALING WITH OUTLIERS

3) FEATURE SCALING

***III) TESTING MULTIPLE MODELS***

1) SPLITTING THE DATASET

2) BUILDING AND TESTING MODEL

***IV) BUILDING THE BEST MODEL FOR PREDICTION***

1) ANALYSIS OF 2 MODELS: CONFUSION MATRIX AND CLASSIFICATION REPORT

2) FINDING THE BEST MODEL:

A- LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS

B- LOGISTIC REGRESSION: a) Avoid Overfitting with penalty, b) Best parameter

3) APPLY NEW PARAMETER AND TRAIN IT

4) MODIFY THE THRESHOLD

***V) MAKE PREDICTION***

***VI) CONCLUSION***
